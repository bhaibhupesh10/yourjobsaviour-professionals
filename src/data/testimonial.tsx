    content: "I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Vimal Sir. His guidance helped me overcome my fear of Kubernetes, and today, I feel confident in working with itâ€”all thanks to his exceptional teaching. Started internship in devops but I was struggling to understand docker, Kubernetes and cloud concepts. Then one of my colleague told me about Vimal sir. I watched docker playlist available on youtube and that helped me also to understand container concept. After sometime launched AWS Cloud Enablement Training and this helped me to understand aws services in best possible way. Specially VPC and networking that I'll never forget. In simple words, whatever I'm now just because of Vimal sir's training and his unique way to explain the concept. Vimal sir's unique and simple style of teaching.",

This experience taught me the value of perseverance and continuous learning, and I hope it inspires others to keep striving toward their goals. What I appreciated most about LinuxWorld and Mr. Vimal Daga was the exceptional learning experience during the Workshop on AWS Cloud with AI. His expertise and ability to simplify complex topics like AWS, cloud computing, and Python made the workshop impactful and inspiring. My placement journey was a mix of challenges and growth. After facing four final-round rejections, including one with IBM, I reflected on my approach and focused on smart, hard work. Participating in the Workshop on AWS Cloud with AI by LinuxWorld in August 2023 was a turning point, equipping me with practical skills and confidence.",
